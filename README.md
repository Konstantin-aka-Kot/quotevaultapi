The API allow:

1. Creation of a user account (deletion and other CRUD operations not requested). User properties are name, email, password and date of creation;
2. Addition, viewing (including a method to get a random quote), modification, and deletion of quotes (real deletion from the database, not just via an archive flag). Quote properties include content, date of creation / update, link to user who posted it, link to votes;
3. Voting on quotes (either upvote or downvote);
4. View of the top and worse 10 quotes, the details of each quote.
